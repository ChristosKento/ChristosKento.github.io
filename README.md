    <h1>My first website</h1>
    
    <p>This is my first time using HTML to create a webpage. I have been learning through my online course about the basics of coding. However, this is me trying to atually code and to make somewhat of a decent page. I will just keep adding more code so hopefully the page becomes more advanced.</p>
    
<div>As of 05/10/24 it hasn't even been a week since I started to learn how to code. To be honest, this page isn't being constrcuted from what I've learned from the course but rather trial and error, and using online resources. </div>
